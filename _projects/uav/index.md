title: Dynamics and Control of Autonomous Flight
description: This course explores the modeling, dynamics, and control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a focus on quadcopters. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on labs, students analyze aerodynamic forces, develop kinematic and dynamic models in 3D, and apply control strategies to stabilize and maneuver UAVs. A major component involves programming a microcontroller to execute a model-based controller on a flying platform.

## Objective
The objective of this course was to equip students with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to analyze, model, and control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By combining lecture-based instruction with hands-on laboratory experience, the course aimed to develop a deep understanding of flight dynamics, sensor integration, and real-time embedded control. Students applied these concepts by designing and implementing model-based controllers on microcontroller-driven UAV platforms.
