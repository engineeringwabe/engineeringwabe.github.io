## Overview  
SowBot is a reforestation robot developed to assist park rangers and conservation 
teams in planting seeds across difficult, off-road terrain. Our goal was to reduce the 
physical labor and time required for ecosystem restoration using a modular, robust robot 
capable of automated digging and seed deposition.

### My Role  
I led the design and fabrication of the hopper system, using Onshape for CAD modeling and 
rapid prototyping techniques to bring it to life. In addition to my mechanical 
contributions, I assisted in debugging and refining the codebase, including tuning PID 
controllers to improve performance. I also played a key role in integrating the control system,
using the ESP32 microcontroller to coordinate motor drivers and subsystem timing. Throughout 
the project, I collaborated closely with teammates to fine-tune various components and ensure
smooth system integration.

### Challenges & Lessons  
One of our biggest challenges was ensuring that each subsystem functioned reliably when 
integrated—particularly synchronizing the auger motion with the seed release timing. Through 
frequent prototyping and testing, we quickly realized the importance of clearly defining 
interfaces early in the design process and coordinating realistic timelines across subteams. 
A key difficulty was managing team collaboration—assigning responsibilities, planning meetings,
and maintaining alignment. Early in the project, we learned that consistent and open communication 
between subteams is essential to achieve seamless integration of all components into a cohesive system.
